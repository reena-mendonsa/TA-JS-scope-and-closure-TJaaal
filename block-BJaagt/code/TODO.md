Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

```js
function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output  ReferenceError: useranme is not defined
```

In above code we are looking for the variable named `usename`. There is no variable named `username` in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named `hello` and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error `Reference Error username is not defined`.

2. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(useranme); // output
```

The `username` is defined within a scope and not a global variable,hence we get error 
`Reference Error username is not defined`.

3. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // output
```
The variable `username` is defined within a  scope of if statement and not global variable,and since no condition is specified it does not enter the if stmt hence we get Error msg
 `ReferenceError: useranme is not defined`.

4. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // output  ReferenceError: useranme is not defined
```

5. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // output
```
Since `userame ` is declared as a global variable and again declared inside the if stmt we get and error `SyntaxError: Identifier 'username' has already been declared`.

6. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // output John
```

7. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
let username = 'John';
function sayHello() {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
sayHello();
console.log(useranme); // output John
```

8. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // output
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // output
```
0 "First"
 1 "First"
 2 "First"
 3 "First"
 4 "First"
 5 "First"
 6 "First"
 7 "First"
 8 "First"
 9 "First"
 10 "Second"


9. Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // output
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // output
```
0 "First"
 1 "First"
 2 "First"
 3 "First"
 4 "First"
 5 "First"
 6 "First"
 7 "First"
 8 "First"
 9 "First"
ReferenceError: i is not defined
